# Use Docker to contribute to open source

# Abstract (300 characters)

# Description (markdown)
* Useful contribution to an project: docker file and scripts to help new and old contributors alike.
* Easier to contribute over the long haul. You don't have to keep your environment up-to-date or deal with conflicting dependencies.
* Gain experience with a popular devops tool.
* More easily contribute from a Mac or Windows development machine.
* Run the same commands as the CI build so you know if it will fail immediately, before submitting the PR.

# Bio
Carolyn is a software developer based in the wilds of suburban Chicago. Her passion is dev tools, creating command-line tools for other developers. Working on the containers team at Rackspace, Docker became her go to way to automate arcane build commands and dev tasks. She has since graduated to being a full-time contributor to her favorite open-source projects: the upcoming Go dependency manager, Kubernetes, and the Docker Version Manager. She recently founded the Chicago chapter of Women Who Go to share her love of Go, containers, and excessive emoji with her peers.
