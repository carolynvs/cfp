## Bio

Carolyn is a software developer based in the wilds of suburban Chicago, working remotely on the Microsoft Azure Containers team. Her passion is developer tools, and automating all the things with a sidecar of containers. She is a maintainer for the Go dependency manager (dep), a Kubernetes contributor, and Service Catalog SIG member. As an organizer for Women Who Go, she regularly hauls her cookies across the world to share her love of Go, Kubernetes, and excessive emoji with her peers.
