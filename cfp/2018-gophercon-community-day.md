# GopherSource: Open Source for Gophers

Everyone says how welcoming the Go Open Source Community is, but it can still be a bit intimidating and overwhelming when you first join. Led by Carolyn Van Slyck, during this full-day workshop you’ll learn how to become a valued contributor and member of any open source community.

Today’s workshop will help you:
* Understand what "open source" is and why you may want to participate.
* Discover the many ways that you can contribute.
* Set expectations around being a newcomer, contributor, member and a maintainer.
* Learn about welcoming open-source projects, such as Go itself and the upcoming Go Proxy and Registry (Athens), and how you can become involved.
* Setup your laptop to try out these projects and start contributing!

This will run at the same time as the other community day activities. If you are new to open source, the beginning of this workshop will be especially valuable to you, but if you can only stay for part of it, that's okay too!
