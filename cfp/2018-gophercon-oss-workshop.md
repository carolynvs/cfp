# Title
Open Source 101

# Description
Everyone says how welcoming the Go Open Source Community is, but it can still be a bit intimidating and overwhelming when you first join. Led by Carolyn Van Slyck and Blossom Coryat, during this full-day workshop you’ll learn how to become a valued contributor and member of any open source community.
Today’s course will help you:
* Understand what "open source" is and why you may want to participate
* Discover the many ways that you can contribute
* Set expectations around being a newcomer, contributor, member and a maintainer
* Progress from the first PR to being a project member and even a maintainer
* Evaluate open source projects
* Build safe, welcoming communities... and know which ones to avoid
* Practice git commands and get comfortable with what to do when merge conflicts occur

The beginning of this workshop is suitable for people of all experience levels, while the end is dedicated to hands-on activities with git, github and gerrit where you can get 1:1 help setting up your laptop, learn more about git merge and rebase, or try out what you've learned without worrying about making a mistake on a "real" pull request.
