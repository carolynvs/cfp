# Title
GopherSource: OpenSource for Gophers

# Abstract
Goâ€™s reputation for having a great community often precedes it. At the same time
figuring out how to contribute and influence upstream Go is intimidating. A band
of plucky gophers are working together to change that, clearing the way for more
community involvement, and I want you to join us!
