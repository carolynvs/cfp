# Title
DIY Home Netflix

# Abstract (900)
Are you looking for an excuse to try Kubernetes? How about converting your DVD collection into a DIY Home Netflix! If you have an old computer lying around, you have enough horsepower to build a Kubernetes cluster and put it to good use.

Starting from only a basic understanding of Kubernetes, learn how to:
* Build out a Kubernetes cluster at home.
* Transcode DVDs into a digital format using HandBrake.
* Install HandBrk8s on your cluster to transcode multiple videos at once.
* Watch your movies from your TV, just like Netflix!

The payoff? Never having to get off the couch to put in a disc ever again.

Carolyn is the author of HandBrk8s, HandBrake on Kubernetes. She is also the proud owner of her very own My Little Pony cluster, which has taken over her guest bedroom. She will walk through how HandBrk8s takes advantage of Kubernetes to simplify resiliently transcoding DVDs on a cluster.

# Benefits to the Ecosystem (900)
I want to give everyone the excuse they need to learn.

Not everyone is lucky enough to work at a company where they are paid to learn new tech as their day job. Most live behind the adoption curve. They need ideas and a space to learn on their own time. The DIY Home Netflix project is well-suited for a "nights and weekend project", and is something that most people could see themselves trying out at home.

The talk is an amusing hour where they see an example of Kubernetes outside of the usual "important business" domain. Some may take it further and set up a cluster for the first time, installing something beyond the obligatory hello world app. A few may even go beyond the tutorial, and end up with a cluster running in a closet or spare bedroom, and using it for tangible workloads that makes their evenings a bit more entertaining.
