# Title
DIY Home Netflix

# Abstract
Are you looking for an excuse to try Kubernetes? How about converting your DVD collection into a DIY Home Netflix! If you have at least one computer lying around, you have enough horsepower to build a Kubernetes cluster and put it to good use.

Starting from only a basic understanding of Kubernetes, learn how to:
* Build out a Kubernetes cluster at home.
* Transcode DVDs into a digital format using HandBrake.
* Install HandBrk8s on your cluster to transcode multiple videos at once.
* Watch your movies from your TV, just like Netflix!

The payoff? Never having to get off the couch to put in a disc ever again.

Carolyn is the author of HandBrk8s, HandBrake on Kubernetes. She is also the proud owner of her very own My Little Pony cluster, which has taken over her guest bedroom. She will walk through how HandBrk8s takes advantage of Kubernetes to simplify resiliently transcoding DVDs on a cluster.

# Benefits to the Ecosystem
I want to give everyone the excuse they need to learn.

Not everyone is lucky enough to work at a company where new technology is widely adopted, and they are paid to learn and use it for their day job. Most live behind the adoption curve. They need ideas and a space to learn Kubernetes on their own time. The DIY Home Netflix project is well-suited for a "nights and weekend project", and is something that most people could see themselves trying out at home.

For those who attend the talk, it's an amusing hour where they see an example of using Kubernetes outside of the usual "important business" domain. Some may take it further and set up a cluster for the first time, and install something beyond the obligatory hello world app. A few may even go beyond the tutorial, and end up with a permanent cluster running in a closet or spare bedroom, and use their cluster for real, tangible workloads that makes their evenings a bit more entertaining.

In fact this was how I first dug into Kubernetes outside of work. I know this is a great side-project because at first it was my side-project. My Little Cluster Story is the tale behind how this all came together: http://carolynvanslyck.com/blog/2017/10/my-little-cluster/.
