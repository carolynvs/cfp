# Title (75)
The Devil Is in the Deployments

## Description (900)
Can you deploy your entire app from scratch with a Helm install? Or do you
have cloud infra and hosted services that you rely on? The cloudy bits that make
your app cloud native.

Cloud Native Application Bundles, the CNAB spec, was designed to solve
deployment problems that we all have been quietly battling with, mostly with
hope and bash. Bundles come in handy when deploying applications that don't live
neatly inside of just Kubernetes.

Let's learn when bundles make sense, when they don't, and what your day could
look like if you were using them:

* Install tools to manage your app: helm, aws/azure/gcloud, terraform.
* Deploy your app along with its infra: cloud storage, dns entry, load balancer, ssl cert.
* Get software and its dependencies into airgapped networks.
* Manage disparate operational tech, such as Helm or Terraform, across
  teams and departments.
* Secure our pipeline.

## Notes (1500)
Cloud Native Application Bundles, CNAB, is a specification in the Joint
Development Foundation under the Linux Foundation, co-developed by Microsoft,
Pivotal, Docker, Bitnami and Hashicorp. There are several open-source tools and
libraries such as Duffle, Porter, Docker App and cnab-go that implement the CNAB
spec. Porter is all set to be submitted to the CNCF Sandbox this July.

Instead of diving into the details of the spec, or how to use one of these
tools, I want to help people understand the types of problems CNAB solves, and
what it would look like before and after bundles are introduced into their
stack. The goal is for people to leave with an understanding of what CNAB is,
when bundles are the right tool for the job, when they aren't, and inspire
people to learn more about making and using bundles.

CNAB is relevant to CloudNativeCon because it is a specification designed to
operate cloud native applications, agnostic of any particular cloud or tooling.
It can be used to manage cloud infrastructure, a kubernetes cluster, cloud
native applications, and works well with tooling like Helm, Terraform, etc. So
while the specification may not be in the CNCF, it was designed to work with the
tools in the CNCF.

Carolyn is a software developer based in the wilds of suburban Chicago, working
on the Microsoft DeisLabs team. Her passion is developer tools, and building
vibrant inclusive communities around them. She is a maintainer for the CNAB
specification and Porter, an open-source tool that builds and manages Cloud
Native Application Bundles.

In between code reviews, Carolyn enjoys hauling her virtual cookies around the
world to share her love of open-source, containers, and excessive emoji. ðŸŒˆ âœ¨

### Outline

If you can deploy your cloud native app without any cloud infrastructure
or hosted services, is it really cloud native? ðŸ˜‚
