Doing OSS with Docker

* clean machine experiment
* docker build all the things instead of installing locally
* if you are a maintainer, this makes life sooooo much easier for contributors
** double plus points for taking what's in the travis/circle/appveyor file and making it easy for people to run before the PR
* if you are an infrequent contributor, this makes YOUR life easier because you won't forget how to run things after having a life for a bit
* how do I track these files if the upstream repo doesn't want them checked-in?
* next level fun times: minikube
** why is this worth doing? besides learning k8's
* patterns for various repos:
** ruby
** golang
** jekyll/middleman
