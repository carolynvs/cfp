# Title (150 characters)
Docker 101: Run your first Docker container today

Docker helps you package an application with its dependencies, develop and deploy it anywhere. Learn about this up-and-coming technology and why you would want to use it.

Suitable for beginners and seasoned developers, we'll cover the fundamentals you need to understand Docker and then jump right into working with Docker containers.

This is an interactive workshop, so bring your laptop.
