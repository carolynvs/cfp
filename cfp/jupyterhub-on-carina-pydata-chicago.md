# Title
JupyterHub and Carina: The Ultimate Learning Environment

# Abstract
Jupyter is an exciting tool, empowering you to quickly dive into the fun parts
of whatever problem you are solving. With it, you can do so much more than just your research.
By combining JupyterHub with Carina, you have a learning platform, perfect for leading a workshop,
trying a new language or just playing around with code. It provides push button user notebooks,
where each user is not only isolated from others, but they are running on their own compute resources
and can hit the "reset" button at any time to start fresh.

Learn how howtowhale.com uses JupyterHub and Carina to teach Docker,
with zero setup and immediate results. With these essential building blocks,
you too can create the ultimate learning environment.

# Agenda
Lay down a baseline for why we want to run JupyterHub ourselves and what's neat
about connecting it to Carina. Then using HowToWhale as an example, we will walk
through the infrastructure and configuration necessary to create your own on-demand user notebooks.

# Takeaway
Learn how to setup your own JupyterHub instance and have user notebooks created on Carina.

# Speaker bio
Carolyn is a software developer from Chicago, though one day she hopes
to escape to the Pacific Northwest in search of faster internet, free-range kittens
and respite from snow blowers. She loves all things automation, developer tools
and anything that will make her fellow developers lives easier; so she's found a good home
at Rackspace on the Developer Experience team where she has been developing
developer tools and tutorials for Docker and Carina.
