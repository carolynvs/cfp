### Title (60 chars)

Grow your users from an unlikely source: Windows developers

### Abstract (600 chars)
You may not realize it but there are a lot of Windows developers moving into your neighborhood. They are using and contributing to open source projects, even those that aren't just for Windows. But here's the rub: Often tools are written "Unix first", shoehorning Windows support in later.  This approach can shut out potential users.

Lucky for us, Go has strong support for cross-platform development. So let's start writing cross-platform first and welcome our Windows neighbors. Learn some of the Windows quirks that you should take into account, and the Go goodies to help you conquer them.

### Speaker bio (500 chars)
Carolyn is a software developer from Chicago, though one day she hopes
to escape to the Pacific Northwest in search of faster internet, free-range kittens
and respite from snow blowers. She loves all things automation, developer tools
and anything that will make her fellow developers lives easier; so she's found a good home
at Rackspace on the Developer Experience team. Like a grafted bonsai,
her roots come from many places: happily developing C# applications on a Mac and deploying to Linux.

### Details
This is additional information for the selection panel.

#### Theme
Developers who only work with Mac OS X and Linux may not be aware that
they have a big, untapped user base. Windows developers used to work in
isolation, but not anymore thanks to the popularity of git, node and Docker.
Not only is Microsoft embracing open source, but enterprises are finally allowing
their developers to use open source libraries and tools.

This is an opportunity, especially for open source projects, but some struggle
with how to get started, as they aren't Windows users themselves.

#### Takeaways
* Want to grow your project? Start welcoming these new Windows users.
* Learn about Go's features for writing cross-platform first applications.
* Make it easy for Windows developers to contribute to your project, and
  they can help ease the load of supporting multiple platforms.

#### Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation
