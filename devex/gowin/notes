<intro slide>
Hellooooooo gophers! I am so excited to be here at my first GopherCon.
Today we're going to dive into my favorite topic: go and windows.
Many of you may already know that go is awesome for cross platform development
and I'll touch on the whys and hows later. What I really want to share with you all
is how you can improve the user experience of your app on Windows and lure
windows devs into contributing to your project.

Why am I talking about Windows? Go has cross-platform support, aren't we good? Can't we just stop there?

<incoming slide>
Let me give you a little bit of my own background and experience with windows development. Back in the day,
my dev machine was Windows, I used an all MS stack, coded in visual studio, deployed to windows server and
my users were all on Windows as well. It was a bit of a bubble, comfy but a bubble. On the flip side,
the other half had linux dev machines, used a much more heterogeneous stack, most of it taking advantage of
open source software, and users often looked pretty similar to them. While there certainly were cross platform applications,
most users I knew were either in one camp or the other, and didn't much care what the other side was up to.

If you think the world is still like that today, its not. My dev machine is a mac,
I write services and apps in multiple languages that all work together (go, ruby, javascript, python),
I still run Visual Studio for my C# development, but only through parallels, I deploy to linux servers,
docker containers, multiple clouds, and I support my users on linux, mac and windows. While I'd like to think
that I'm a super special snowflake, pretty sure I'm not! :-)

Here's my take on how this shift occurred. For me, it all started with git. SVN wasn't cutting anymore
and I installed msysgit on my windows machine. Then I needed to do front-end development,
and installed npm, bower and grunt. And a lot of these tools just worked better on linux, and hey
what do you know, not only do those shiny macs now support dual booting into windows,
but they have bash, and most of these tools just worked without all the odd quirks when I'd run them on windows.
Overall the developer experience on the "other side" was just better.
Don't get me wrong, VS is still the bees knees, but that is just a small slice of a much bigger pie.
Did you see what just dropped last week? .net core 1.0, C# on mac, linux and windows,
without mono, without visual studio, just open up your favorite text editor, and you're in business.
Personally, I don't think MS decided to do this for altruistic reasons. I think they saw
devs like me, leaving the nest and the only way to stay relevant was to stop living in the bubble and
go where the devs are.

The walls between our communities are crumbling down and there's a horde of windows devs are coming over to play.

<spongebob slide>
A lot of tools and applications are still written "linux first", compiles for windows and then
"well I hope it works!". When we just do that, this is the result.

I've found some cool new tool or app that I want to use on my windows machine. It "cross platform",
should work right?

eeeeh not so much. There's no installer, but I can copy a rando binary or build it myself.
It works great on a mac, not so much on windows. So I head over to the documentation,
and they only have examples for bash. Oh wait, I found a bug! No problem I'll just submit a PR....
but I can't build on windows. Hmm, maybe this isn't really cross platform and they don't really want me here.

<me slide>
I care about user experience and want everyone using my code to think its awesome. When I get a report
that it didn't work, I feel bad about it. It's this this mix of guilt and love of developer tools
that landed me on the Rackspace Developer Experience team, where not only
am I responsible for a couple projects but I am sort of our resident windows ambassador and/or apologist
depending on how well my day is going. I work with my teammates to ensure that
our products don't suck on windows.

<dvm slide>
I'm about to give you some advice for go on windows, I swear it's coming!, and
here's where I've tried all this out.
* My favorite is the dvm, the docker version manager. You've got a node version manager, a ruby version manager,
  so of course docker needs one too! And it worked great, on mac and linux. because it original was a bash script.
  This was my head first dive into go. Never written anything with it before and
  my first PR to dvm was rewriting the entire thing in go.
* Carina, was originally written in go, and we were taking advantage of the cross compilation but guess what?
  It compiled but had quirky bugs that only showed up on windows. oops!
* I've also helped out with another go project, the rackspace cli, where I added windows installer so
  that when we had doc that said "go install it with homebrew,ooh soo easy",
  we could have a similarly awesome experience on windows.

These are my street creds. :-) I'm still very new to go, but not building go apps on windows.

<cross platform code slide>
Alrighty, let's talk about go! Go's support for cross-platform is a bit deceptive in its simplicity.
It seems like you just need to cross compile and you're done
But that's just the foundation of what I consider first class windows support.
Just like maslow's hierarchy of needs, compilation the equivalent of survival but I want more.

<cross compile slide>
So let's see just how easy it is. TADA! I built my magical app for windows. This is why I love go over
C#, Java and Python.

<conditional compilation slide>
But wait go has more goodies! conditional compilation. Sometimes, you need different
logic or values on based on the os or arch and this is how you do it.
Essentially you separate out into different files, what code should be compiled
for a particular os and arch. Go is smart, it can figure it out based
on the file extension, but comments are more flexible. Checkout magic.nix.go,
go has no clue what "nix" is, but the comment says "nix is anything that ain't windows",
targeting both mac and linux and all the other non windows os's out there.

<magic code slide>
Let's take a look. In my magical app, I need a magical file path and it's different
for windows and everything else.
On "nix", I use bash and store files in the HOME directory.
On windows, I use PowerShell and store files in my user profile directory.
When I run "go build", depending on which OS I'm targeting, go will build in the appropriate function definition.
Pretty straightforward though it can result in a lot of files.

That's how go does it's thing, and the rest is up to you. In order to support windows,
it really helps to understand some of the differences and quirks on windows.
First, environment variables. Say you want to store files in the users's home directory,
* Use USERPROFILE in place of HOME. done!
* Next is path. Both have the same name but nix uses colons and win uses semi-colons.
* Shell is a fun one. On nix it tells you the preferred shell.
  But that normally isn't defined on windows, so figuring out when to use powershell or cmd can be a challenge.
* TMPDIR points to a location where I can work with temporary files, such as /tmp,
  on windows you can either use tmp or temp, they both contain the same value.
  So pick one based on however much you love or hate vowels.
* This last one isn't well known but quite useful. PATHEXT contains a list of common file extensions
  to look for when a user executes a command without a file extension. So if I have a binary called magic.exe,
  I can run it simply by typing magic, and windows will figure it out. This can come in handy when
  writing cross-platform scripts.

Next up, the dreaded file paths. Most people expect this to be the worst part of supporting windows,
when go makes it dirt simple. Just stick with using the filepath library, and you are all set.
When it comes to scripting though, here's a few tips:
* Most of windows doesn't care if you use forward or back slashes.
* Always quote file paths. It's quite common on windows to have whitespace in paths
* Very excited about this, windows 10 has removed the 260 character file path limit.
  If you have ever used used npm 2 (not 3) on windows, uh it totally broke everything.
  NPM would create heavily nested paths in node_modules that were so long that they were "undeletable".
  Not using file explorer, powershell, cmd, bash, etc and commands like git clean would fail... fun times.
  For the longest time, npm's initial reaction to this was quite unhelpful. This is a perfect example of
  "supporting" windows while completely falling on your face.

<user experience slide>
So from a code perspective, we are pretty solid. What's the next level? User experience,
what can we do to make it better.

<doc slide>
Documentation! I salute everyone who writes documentation, it's important and often undervalued.
Key areas that impact the windows experience are how to install, how to use and how to contribute.
Heck, just letting people know that we support windows, that it should work and let us know if it doesn't, helps.

<doc example slide>
Here's an example of how I document installation commands. As you start to support more than on os,
you also end up supporting more than one shell and usually more than one package manager.
It helps to show the shell prompt to subtly indicate if the command
is bash (a dollar sign) or powershell (a greater than sign).

<shells slide>
A quick note about documentation and shells. At some point, you're going to want to document a command,
and it helps to be aware that on Windows, there are a number of shells out there:
* cmd - everyone knows it, everyone has it, but it too limited to use in most cases.
* powershell - more powerful than cmd, though quirky at first
  FYI, there multiple versions of powershell out in the wild.
* bash - usually available on dev machines, but not for non-dev users and
  you got to watch out as bash isn't 100% the same on windows.

<installation slide>
If you have an installable application, i.e. not a library, provide an installer.
You can try to get by on "go install", but that only works for developers and
even then, isn't my favorite installation experience. Luckily making a windows installer is very easy,
there's a package manager chocolatey, that is like apt-get
or homebrew for windows. Then installing is a simple as choco install magic.

At the very least, provide an installation script. This is the PowerShell equivalent
of piping into bash, where in 1 line we download and execute a script.

<choco slide>
Here's what chocolatey looks like. I define my package with a nuspec file,
set some metadata and then specify the file(s) to distribute.
To ship it, it's just 2 commands, first package it up then push it to chocolatey.org
Now when a user wants to try out your app, they just use choco install, the binary is
immediately available on their PATH and it just works.

<install script slide>
Now, here's an example of a installation shell script. First I check if they have PS 4+,
I download my binary and then print instructions for how to add it to their path.

<contributor slide>
Alright! We are doing really well. We have cross platform code, we have users, yay!
Now let's make life easier for ourselves and any brave souls who want to helps us maintain the project.

<field of dreams slide>
If you want people to contribute to your project, help fix bugs, add features,
they need to be able to build it on their machine.

<build goal slide>
For every project I work on, my goal is that anyone can just clone, run one script and they are all set.
Preferably it handles obtaining any extra build tools, like a dependency manager if missing.
At the very least, let people know if the doc of any required build tools.

<lolnix slide>
Let's take a short detour here to talk about build scripts.
It's usually not enough to have the programming language installed. Build scripts are written
either in  a shell script such as bash or using a specialized build tool like make.
Aaaaand that isn't a huge problem for win devs! Because lolnix.
lolnix is my made up term for a linux-like environment on windows, which whether they know it or not,
most windows devs have already! So where did it come from? GIT!
Any windows developer who has git, also has lolnix. At the bare minimum,
they have installed "Git for Windows", which comes with bash and a bunch of other tools like
grep, cat, sed, awk, etc. Another way to get lolnix is by installing cygwin or my favorite, Git for Windows SDK.
The SDK provides everything from Git for Windows but also comes with a package manager, pacman.
And with pacman you can easily install other tools, like make! So the ability to run a
bash script or have make installed, isn't in my mind an unreasonable ask.

<makefile slide>
Here's a simple Makefile for building our magic application. It ensures that our dependency manager,
in this case glide, is installed before retrieving our dependencies.
Then has targets to either build a specific platform, or build all the things.

<bash script slide>
Alternatively, this is a bash script that does essentially the same thing,
minus some of the niceties of make such as being able to execute a specific target.
This script again gets our dependencies then builds all the things.

<ci slide>
Now on my pyramid, CI, continuous integration, is the final step. Don't take from this that I don't value CI.
Only that you need the other layers in place before tackling CI.

<appveyor slide>

The slides are available online where you can find links to all my cheat sheets
and more info on some of the areas I zoomed past.

<takeout slide>
Sweet! So that's my crash course for developing with go for windows.
I hope you have picked up a few new tricks and if you have any others that I didn't
cover, I'd love to hear about them!
